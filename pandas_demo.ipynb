    "## What is ***Pandas***?\n",
    "\n",
    "***Pandas*** is a Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. It is built on top of the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package, which means that a lot of the NumPy functions are also available in ***Pandas***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Pandas*** is particularly useful for working with structured data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, and it provides tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data structures in ***Pandas*** are the `Series` and `DataFrame` classes. A `Series` is essentially a column, and a `DataFrame` is a multi-dimensional table made up of a collection of `Series`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Pandas*** provides many useful functions for working with data, such as grouping and aggregation functions, and it also provides plotting functions to create visualizations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some of the basic functionality of ***Pandas***, including how to create `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, how to read and write data, and how to perform basic data manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of ***Pandas***, it is recommended that you view the [official Getting Started tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html)."
